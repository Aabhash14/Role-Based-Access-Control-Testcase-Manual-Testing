Testing Description:
I conducted manual Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) testing to validate user authentication and authorization across different roles, including HR and Manager. The testing verified login functionality, dashboard access, customer data visibility, permission restrictions for Create/Update/Delete actions, and logout behavior. The execution identified access control gaps where restricted actions were incorrectly available to the HR role, highlighting authorization defects.
